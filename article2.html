        <p>If a person were to travel close to the speed of light, time for them would slow down compared to someone who remained still. This idea, known as time dilation, seems to go against common sense, yet it is one of the most extraordinary and well-tested predictions of Einstein’s theory of relativity.</p>

        <p>When first encountered, time dilation appears paradoxical. How can time itself, something we think of as steady and universal, behave differently depending on how fast someone is moving? The answer lies in Einstein’s insight that space and time are not separate, but part of a single structure called spacetime. To ensure that the laws of physics stay the same for everyone, the universe adjusts both distance and time depending on motion.</p>

        <p>A famous thought experiment explains this idea. Imagine a pair of twins, Alex and Sam. Alex stays on Earth while Sam travels through space at nearly the speed of light. For Sam, the trip might last only a few years, but when they return, decades have passed for Alex. This situation, called the twin paradox, has been supported by real evidence.</p>

        <p>In 1971, scientists carried out the Hafele–Keating experiment, flying two precise atomic clocks around the world on commercial aircraft while identical clocks remained on the ground. When compared afterwards, the clocks on the planes had measured slightly less time. The difference was only a few billionths of a second, but it matched Einstein’s predictions exactly.</p>

        <p>Time dilation is not only a theoretical idea but a real effect used in technology. The Global Positioning System (GPS) depends on satellites that orbit Earth. Because they travel quickly and experience weaker gravity than clocks on the ground, their time runs slightly differently. Engineers constantly correct for these differences so that GPS data remains accurate. Without these corrections, GPS systems would give results that were wrong by several kilometres each day.</p>

        <p>Relativity also shows that gravity can change the flow of time. According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, massive objects bend spacetime, and this slows time near the object. This means time passes a little slower on Earth’s surface than it does high above the planet, something scientists have measured using atomic clocks.</p>

        <p>These ideas have completely changed how we understand time. It is not absolute or universal, but relative to movement and gravity. The effect is tiny in everyday life but important in space. Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, experience time about 0.01 seconds slower each year than people on Earth because of their speed.</p>

        <p>Time dilation also raises interesting questions about space travel. If humans could one day move close to the speed of light, they might return to find that centuries had passed on Earth while they had only experienced a few years.</p>

        <p>What makes time dilation so fascinating is that it connects physics with how we experience life. We feel time as something constant, yet physics shows it can stretch or shrink depending on where we are and how we move. Einstein once said that the difference between past, present and future is only a persistent illusion. Perhaps the lesson is that time, which feels so ordinary to us, is far more flexible and complex than we imagine.</p>
