        <p>In autumn, trees turn from green to orange, yellow and red. I always wondered why that happens. It turns out it’s because of what’s inside the leaves. Leaves are green because they have something called chlorophyll. It helps the tree make food from sunlight. When it gets colder and darker in autumn, the tree doesn’t make as much food, so the chlorophyll breaks down. Then the green fades away because chlorophyll is green.</p>

        <p>Then you can see the other colours that were already in the leaf, like orange and yellow from carotenoids and red from anthocyanins. Different trees have different pigments, which is why they look different in autumn. After a while the leaves dry out and fall off because the tree doesn’t need them during winter. It’s like the tree is resting until spring comes back.</p>
