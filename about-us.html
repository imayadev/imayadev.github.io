          Iâ€™m Maya, a young science enthusiast with a passion for making science more accessible, engaging, and relevant for kids and teens. This collaborative journal brings together articles, artwork and more, which I hope will encourage your curiosity and inspire clearer thinking about the world around us.

          My aim is to create a platform where young people can explore science beyond the classroom, build confidence in communicating ideas, and share work that they are truly proud of.

          Want to get involved? Visit the Submit Work page to contribute your own article, science-inspired artwork, or any other work!

          Whether it's space, chemistry, animals, or cool inventions, my goal is to share knowledge in a way
          that's fun and easy to explore.
